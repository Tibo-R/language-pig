# Pig package for Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and autocompletion to Pig scripts in Atom.

In order to have the full autocompletion system, you need the atom package [Autocomplete Snippets](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-snippets) 

#Based on the work from :

- lumengxi : https://github.com/lumengxi/language-pig (atom package)
- chrislongo : https://github.com/chrislongo/Pig (sublime-text package)
